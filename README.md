# ATtiny85 Rubber Ducky Scripts - YouTube "Prank"

This repository contains scripts for the ATtiny85 microcontroller, configured to act as a Rubber Ducky. The scripts are harmless and have an educational purpose, serving as a fun prank that simply opens a YouTube video. There are two scripts: one for Mac OS and one for Windows.

## Description

The ATtiny85 is a small and versatile microcontroller with the ability to behave as a HID (Human Interface Device), such as a keyboard. These scripts leverage this functionality to automate typing commands that open a YouTube link in web browsers as a playful prank.

## Available Scripts

- RickRollingMacOS: Script designed for Mac OS systems.
- RickRollingWindows: Script designed for, guess what, Windows systems.

## Requirements

* An ATtiny85 configured to act as a HID device.
* Software to upload the scripts to the ATtiny85, such as [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

## How to Use

* Clone this repository:
* Choose the script version according to the target operating system (Mac OS or Windows).
* Compile and upload the script to your ATtiny85 using your preferred programming tool.
* Plug the ATtiny85 into a computer. The script will automatically execute, opening the YouTube video.
